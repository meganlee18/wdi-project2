## Usage Instructions
This is a photo-sharing website specifically for people who love to share their travel adventures. To access the site, you need to first become a member by registering for an account. Registration is free to all. After that, log in and start posting your photos!

You can also comment or 'like' the photos on the site.

## Technologies Used
Icons in the website are from https://fontawesome.com

Photos are sourced from https://www.pexels.com/ 

Font used in the website is sourced from Google Fonts.

## Approach to Solving the Problem
The first step is to have high level idea of what the website should look like. The design of the website and basic user interface were created using wireframes.

This website stores information in the sql database, including user information, photos, comments and messages. 

Finally, the server requests are set up and are hosted via Sinatra before deployment to Heroku for public viewing.

### Next Steps...
Due to the timeframe, a minimal viable product (MVP) was created. Further improvements may include more CSS styles, including the adding of animations and the possibility of third party apps relevant to the website.

Storage of photos to AWS (Amazon S3) could also be in store in the future so that users can directly upload photos to the site instead of only the URLs.
